Metastrategy
- Write notes to myself constantly so that I remember what exactly I was doing and what I was trying to do
- More playfulness is ok!
	- Come up with hypotheses about what will happen in the future - and write them down, or draw pictures, or anything
- What are my questions about the research?  The field?  Everything?
- If something's working, find out why.  If something isn't working, find out why.
- If I'm stuck, take some time to write out my problems, or work on the paper.
	- Make sure that there are residual data so that I know *what* I was working on, what the problem was, so I can recreate what I need to
- Keep a log - religiously - of everything I do
	(- Look up how to get Python history)
- Set up Git

To Do List
- Cluster fragments from the same species - do they all cluster together?  Or apart?  Think back to what I was doing with kmer spectra.  We're trying to test whether self-recruiting is reasonable.  How big fragments?  Do lots of genomes.  Use my LotsaGenomes folder.  What is the threshold for fragment size making this plausible?
	- Can something big recruit something smaller?
* SMG = synthetic metagenome
* When I synthesize data, note that there will be natural breaks on repeats.  We won't assemble repeats that are longer than the reads.  
- Once I have the synthesized data, test different clustering algorithms.  ALL of them.
- Synthesize data where metagenomes can have lots of far-apart genes, or have lots of close genes (allowing for chimeric reads)
	- dwgsim - for making reads - https://github.com/nh13/DWGSIM
	- Kiki - for assembling reads - https://github.com/GeneAssembly/kiki
	- Use parameters similar to real data
		- 150 bp for reads
		- coverage > 30, < 1000
- What level of accuracy is useful?  
	- We *have* to be better than random :P
	- Does it associate contigs together?  Do contigs from the same taxon end up in the same cluster?
	- Is it the case that if we have a bunch of contigs that aren't represented in the database but are close to each other, and we try to cluster them using seeds from the db, will all these closely-related contigs end up attached to the same seed?  Do contigs from the same organism end up in the same cluster?
	- It'd be cool if 90% of same-species contigs ended up in the same cluster.  This would be easy if the separation between the taxa is large.  Otherwise, we're probably going to get bins with representatives from lots of species.  Think in terms of false negatives and false positives.  10% false negative rate would be nice.  What about false positives?  
* Remember: we're trying to map most of the contigs from a single organism into a bin so we can reconstruct the genomes.  
- Where's the threshold for having enough genomes to mostly reconstruct a genome?
	- Two questions: coverage and separability.  How much of a genome is in a sample?  Look for genes that occur only once in a genome to get an idea of how many genomes are present.  If we have 180 samples of a particular gene that occurs only once in a genome out of 200 samples that have been identified as part of this taxon (or something like that), then we probably have ~90% coverage.
